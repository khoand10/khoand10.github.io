## Go is a modern, general-purpose programming language.

- Compiled
- Statically typed  
- Garbage collected
- Concurrent
- Simple
- Productive

## What is Go?

Go is object-oriented but:

- no classes
- no subclassing
- implicit interfaces

Simple pieces connected by small interfaces

## History

- Project started in 2007 by Griesemer, Pike and Thompson, at Google
- Open sourced in 2009
- Version 1.0 was released in 2012

## Designed to scale

Designed by and for people who read and write large software systems

Designed to be able to scale to:

- large code bases
- large teams
- large number of dependencies

## Designed to be modern

Should be:

- suitable for multicore machines
- suitable for networked machines
- suitable for the web

## Go is boring

Go's purpose is _not_ research into programming language design

Optimized for reading rather than writing for code

Designed to only use tried and tested features and focus on developer productivity

Your favorite language feature is most likely not in Go
